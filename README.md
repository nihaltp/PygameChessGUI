This is an AI chess game i am trying to make. i make trying to make this with a small step at a time since i am a beginner

Now i have a code that allows me to play against a player
It prints the board in the interface and when we give the initial and final position of the piece it makes a move
It can give you all possible moves, history, end the game, etc.

Steps:
	Learn about pygame,
	Initialise board,
	Initialise chess pieces,
	Integrate the code with pygame:
		show the board and moves,
		allow the user to make moves using mouse,
	Add random ai #just move randomly,
	add actual ai,
	add a machine learning ai,
