[ ]The block for handling chess piece movement could be made more concise to avoid code duplication
[ ]For a more interactive experience, you might want to consider using dialog boxes or other interactive elements instead of console input for names and other inputs.
[ ]Consider replacing magic numbers in your code with named constants. For instance, replace 8 with ROWS or COLUMNS where appropriate.
[ ]The draw_rows and draw_columns functions can be enhanced by using a loop to avoid repetitive code.
[ ]Implement error handling for potential exceptions, especially in the section where moves are processed. It's good to provide clear feedback to users if an invalid move is entered.
[ ]Consider using enumerations for square colors and piece types. This can improve code readability and maintenance.
[ ]Optimize the valid_moves function to avoid clearing and redrawing the entire chessboard for each move. Instead, only update the necessary squares.
[ ]Enhance the user interface with more visual feedback, such as highlighting the squares involved in a move or indicating a checkmate.
